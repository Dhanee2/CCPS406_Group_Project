She was actually my 8th attempt at an algorithm that uses machine learning to develop a better machine learning algorithm - fitting for my lucky number!\n")

Ugh, Rin's always on me about 'profits' and 'safety' and 'not needing to call the ethics comitee every time I find a new project'. 'No, Cords, you can't just try to invent a whole new branch of science when you haven't even finished the last three projects we let you start!' She just doesn't understand the joy of discovery! That's what science is about! Am I rambling? I'm rambling. Well, see you soon!\n")
