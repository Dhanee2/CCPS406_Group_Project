# CCPS406_Group_Project

## Background
The game world is a robotics research facility sometime in the future (maybe 2100 or so). The head of robotics development, currently unnamed but known as The Creator, has successfully designed an all-purpose, adaptable robot. Despite The Creatorâ€™s ambitious dreams for this model, the company finds it most profitable to use as an artificially intelligent cleaner. The Creator refuses to give up on her grand plans and starts working on a secret project in her private workshop inside a storage unit: sentient robotic life. She does all she can and leaves her computer running, testing configuration after configuration to find a stable robotic mind. Unfortunately, this takes far longer than The Creator was anticipating, and she leaves the computer and a spare Cleaner Bot alone in that workshop, forgotten.
