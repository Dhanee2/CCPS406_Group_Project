# CCPS406_Group_Project

## Background
The head of the robotics department at a major tech company has always been excitedly pushing the bounds of technology. One of her greatest projects was developing the first ever sentient artificial intelligence. Having structured and coded all she could, she waited for her program to evolve a stable version that could learn, feel, and decide. After weeks of waiting for her “borrowed” cleaning droid to wake up, she left it alone in her private workshop, and all but forgot about it. 
But it works. The player awakens.
